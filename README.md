### Installing the Project

You'll want to git clone and then change into the project directory. In any directory inside the project, call this command on the command line:
```
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies. Then you'll want to run this command (inside the project):
```
npm start
```
That should start up the server.


You'll then want to go to this URL inside your browser:
```
localhost:3000
```

Voila! Feel free to start uploading photos.
